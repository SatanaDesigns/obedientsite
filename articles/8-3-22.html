        <h2 class="content">it is my 14th birthday:) i guess i am feeling ok, i met a little lizard dude in a rock pile.
            he hung out on my head and shoulder for a few hours, was chill. 10/10 definitely reccommend.
            i got back into discord theme-making a few days ago, and i'm working on a new theme now but 
            i dont really have any motivation currently, and not enough time: too busy with work.
            i also went to the store and got like 4 drinks which was nice i guess.
